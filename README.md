Here is the README.md, a file explaining the process we decided to follow during this work.
Lauch the code kinematics_empty

In tp1, it was a question of studying direct kinematics, we knew the angles of the three engines and we had to determine the coordinates in x, y and z of the point at the end of the arm.

The second tp was on the inverse kinematics, we knew the coordinates of the end of the arm and we had to determine the angles.
